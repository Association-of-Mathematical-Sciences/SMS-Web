      The Association of Mathematical Sciences is an organization that focuses on supporting
       and encouraging student involvement in all fields relating to the mathematical sciences.
        This is accomplished in various ways, such as hosting and competing in academic 
        competitions, operating an active research journal, organizing educational and professional 
        seminars, and connecting members with mentors.
    </p>

    <p class="text-base leading-relaxed text-slate-700 dark:text-[#fef8ec]/80">
      Our organization was founded in 2008 as the Stevens Mathematical Club and had 
      the main goal of supporting students in mathematical competitions. However, in 
      2024, the Stevens Mathematical Club began to take a more active role in the 
      community, and the Association of Mathematical Sciences was born. The following 
      was the creation of our research journal and our seminar series. Now, we 
      consistently work towards improving our current operations as well as promoting 
      future projects.
