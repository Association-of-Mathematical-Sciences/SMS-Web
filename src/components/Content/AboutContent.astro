      The Association of Mathematical Sciences is an organization that focuses on supporting and 
      encouraging students in any field relating to the mathematical sciences. We enable others 
      in our mission by setting up competitions, competing in competitions, running a research 
      journal, organizing seminars, and connecting members with people that can support them.
    </p>

    <p class="text-base leading-relaxed text-slate-700 dark:text-[#fef8ec]/80">
      Our organization began in 2008, starting with the Stevens Mathematical Club as our 
      starting point. Up until 2024 we trained that way, training and competing in 
      competitions, but starting in spring 2025, we decided to do more for our community, 
      and with that the Association of Mathematical Sciences was born. Following was the 
      creation of our research journal and our seminar series. Now we work towards improving 
      what we already have and working on our future projects.
