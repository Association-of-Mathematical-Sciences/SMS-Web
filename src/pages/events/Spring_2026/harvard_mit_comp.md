## Quantitative Trading Competitions for Undergraduates

Harvard, MIT, and other institutions have recently been accepting applications for their **prestigious** quantitative trading competitions for undergraduate students.

These competitions give unprecedented access to connections towards recruiting and the engineers from several sponsoring quantitative firms such as **Citadel**, **JaneStreet**, **Jump Trading**, **Optiver**, and *many* more. (Including free merch!)

An opportunity like this and many others are excellent ways to make connections with prestigious trading firms, so we open this event page to list out events like these with information on how to apply below:
